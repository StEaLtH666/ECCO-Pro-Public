# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project uses semantic versioning for releases. Component versions
(firmware stage, dashboard version, Intelligence model version) are listed in `VERSION.yaml`.

Development before the first public release happened in a private repository; see
[docs/project-history/README.md](docs/project-history/README.md).

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [0.9.0] - first public pre-release

Experimental. One reference installation; per-feature evidence levels are in [SUPPORTED_HARDWARE.md](SUPPORTED_HARDWARE.md).

### Included

- ESPHome firmware `stage3.4` for a classic ESP32 dongle and an ESP32-S3 (N16R8) hardware wrapper, with the guarded write
  transactions (RTC correction, manual six-slot TOU, Free Power, register 244 export mode, Dump-to-Grid), durable recovery
  records, the fallback profile (save / invalidate / compare) and the supervision heartbeat.
- Home Assistant packages, dashboard 7.18.0 and three custom cards; optional InfluxDB Battery Outlook.
- Intelligence V1: shadow-only advisory engine with a configurable battery reserve (default 40 %) and a site-specific
  technical minimum; synthetic examples only; no write path.
- Offline test suites, the proof chain, the declared public-export transition `pub0`, the declared licence-alignment
  transition `lic0`, the site renderer (`tools/ecco_site_render.py`), the public privacy scan and a simple validation
  workflow with every action pinned to a commit SHA.
- Licence: GPL-3.0-or-later for the whole project, including the three custom cards; Lit's BSD-3-Clause notices ship inside
  the two prebuilt card bundles. Contributions need a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off; no CLA.

### Known limitations (not in 0.9.0)

- Dump-to-Grid does not use the configured battery reserve: its firmware enforces only its own stop-level bounds. Reserve
  enforcement for Dump-to-Grid is deferred until it can be hardware-proven.
- Fallback restore and automatic failback are not implemented.
- No automatic optimiser control exists; Intelligence is advisory and shadow-only.
- Exact inverter model and firmware strings of the reference installation are not published (not recorded in the evidence).

### Planned after 0.9.0

- Run the card tests (`npm test`, typecheck, build reproducibility) in CI; automated action-pin updates.
- A step-by-step installation guide and concise public specifications (Dump-to-Grid first).
- Moving the InfluxDB tasks' fixed timezone into the installation profile.
