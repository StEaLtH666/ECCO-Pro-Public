# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project uses semantic versioning for releases. Component versions
(firmware stage, dashboard version, Intelligence model version) are listed in `VERSION.yaml`.

Development before the first public release happened in a private repository; see
[docs/project-history/README.md](docs/project-history/README.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Post-export edit layer (PEX, schema `ecco-pex/1`, foundation entry `pex0`). It is the declared, exact and hash-linked way to change
  files that the `pub0` export froze. The `pub0` proof now runs on the files as of `pub0`, byte for byte. Test and proof
  infrastructure only: no firmware, Home Assistant, dashboard or behaviour change. See
  [docs/dev/post-export-edit-layer.md](docs/dev/post-export-edit-layer.md).
- `ecco_core/` (offline only; no firmware change; no new write path): a host-side reference model with five modules.
  - **State:** raw, normalised and derived observations with source and observation time.
  - **Freshness:** one catalogue of the freshness limits the project already uses, per signal and purpose, each checked
    against its source; limits nobody defined stay unresolved.
  - **Capability:** device capabilities derived only from the capability registry, with unsupported and unknown failing
    closed, plus proof per controller variant.
  - **Authority:** the controller's write authority as one table, checked against the firmware write surface, the
    registry's `read_write` records and the transaction model; plus a pure reference decision model that never
    authorises advisory code.
  - **Bridge:** the single bridge to Intelligence.
- Intelligence V1.1 foundation (shadow, synthetic tests, not yet consumed):
  - the `Advice` explanation format;
  - overnight demand learning with a return-from-away regime check;
  - charge-target advice;
  - Saving Session / export-event advice;
  - reserve-aware Dump-to-Grid stop-level advice.
- New offline test root `ecco_core/tests`.

### Changed

- **Dump-to-Grid command ceiling is configurable at build time.** `ecco_dump_controller_max_ceiling_w` stays the single
  source of truth and keeps its 3000 W default, the only hardware-tested value. A build may select up to 8000 W; values that
  are not a decimal multiple of 100 W, not above the 500 W floor, or above the site TOU ceiling or 8000 W are refused at
  compile time. Above 3000 W everything is **offline only**: 6000 W is the first staged live checkpoint, and 7000-8000 W is
  an architectural capability, not hardware proven. A diagnostic sensor reports the configured value. See
  [docs/dev/dump-to-grid-ceiling.md](docs/dev/dump-to-grid-ceiling.md).
- **The absolute runaway backstop follows the current command above 3000 W.** It was `configured ceiling + 750 W`. It is
  unchanged for any ceiling up to 3000 W, and never looser above it.
- **The W2 fallback-capture warning ("resembles Dump to Grid residue") follows the configured ceiling** instead of a fixed
  3000 W. The W2 wording of the recovery card and of the dashboard's Safety view no longer names a wattage; the dashboard
  line is a declared post-export (PEX) edit of the export-frozen file.

The transaction, ownership, stop and restore model and the Modbus write surface are unchanged.

- `intelligence.replay.inputs_from_history` now builds its inputs through an `ecco_core` snapshot. The result is
  identical for every finite input, and byte-identical engine reports are tested. A reading that is not a finite number
  is now dropped at the snapshot boundary.

### Fixed (documentation)

- `docs/dev/register-provenance.md` swapped the evidence status of two registry records.
- `docs/INVERTER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md` had an out-of-date record count, a statement that no W3 record is writable
  (register 244's policy record is), and an incomplete list of writing scripts.

## [0.9.0] - first public pre-release

Experimental. One reference installation; per-feature evidence levels are in [SUPPORTED_HARDWARE.md](SUPPORTED_HARDWARE.md).

### Included

- ESPHome firmware `stage3.4` for a classic ESP32 dongle and an ESP32-S3 (N16R8) hardware wrapper, with the guarded write
  transactions (RTC correction, manual six-slot TOU, Free Power, register 244 export mode, Dump-to-Grid), durable recovery
  records, the fallback profile (save / invalidate / compare) and the supervision heartbeat.
- Home Assistant packages, dashboard 7.18.0 and three custom cards; optional InfluxDB Battery Outlook.
- Intelligence V1: shadow-only advisory engine with a configurable battery reserve (default 40 %) and a site-specific
  technical minimum; synthetic examples only; no write path.
- Offline test suites, the proof chain, the declared public-export transition `pub0`, the declared licence-alignment
  transition `lic0`, the site renderer (`tools/ecco_site_render.py`), the public privacy scan and a simple validation
  workflow with every action pinned to a commit SHA.
- Licence: GPL-3.0-or-later for the whole project, including the three custom cards; Lit's BSD-3-Clause notices ship inside
  the two prebuilt card bundles. Contributions need a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off; no CLA.

### Known limitations (not in 0.9.0)

- Dump-to-Grid does not use the configured battery reserve: its firmware enforces only its own stop-level bounds. Reserve
  enforcement for Dump-to-Grid is deferred until it can be hardware-proven.
- Fallback restore and automatic failback are not implemented.
- No automatic optimiser control exists; Intelligence is advisory and shadow-only.
- Exact inverter model and firmware strings of the reference installation are not published (not recorded in the evidence).

### Planned after 0.9.0

- Run the card tests (`npm test`, typecheck, build reproducibility) in CI; automated action-pin updates.
- A step-by-step installation guide and concise public specifications (Dump-to-Grid first).
- Moving the InfluxDB tasks' fixed timezone into the installation profile.
